# Run your own AP

**A step-by-step process & templates to run your own AP**

_\* please note that some links will require EE credentials to access_

1. Search EE’s [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com), Slack and [Blogin](https://equalexperts.blogin.co) for previous documents and blogs that relate to your decision. This might well turn up prior decisions, discussions, guidelines and APs that you can learn from. All APs are in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m-2TFRzgoCLVrGppyIFxi8G-9DExv5gG), and are listed [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eeu7q0cStaYkM7iU6JlmCqpwvNpglE7E2C7mbxvtfgc).
2. Use the AP template, filling in the sections described below \([click this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j9wXFM8-UGIYMdaHACBvs-FYLXJSwxjEgAmHtMU89lw/copy?copyDestination=1m-2TFRzgoCLVrGppyIFxi8G-9DExv5gG) to make a copy of the template\).
3. Move the completed document into the [Advice Process -&gt; Proposals folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m-2TFRzgoCLVrGppyIFxi8G-9DExv5gG) and share it with the people you need feedback from.
4. Share the doc in the [\#ap-decisions](https://equalexperts.slack.com/messages/CCFLF2KM5) Slack channel. You can do this before, during or after you’ve received feedback.

Note that it’s important we don’t bog ourselves down in bureaucracy. The Advice Process is only required for a decision that is [useful for others to know about](https://equalexperts.blogin.co/single-post.php?id=62082).

There’s no need to record decisions where the following points apply:

* There is limited impact and limited investment, AND
* You’re following a mature set of guidelines \(e.g. [training and conferences](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-CbaP254Tw62C7EtqvgXOKW2nw0sOjivyw4Aj9xuJvY/edit?usp=sharing)\) that you agree apply to your circumstances.

For everything else, please capture your decision – at the latest after you’ve completed the Advice Process. Be sure to record the following:

**Proposal title:** Decision headline

**Impacted Business Unit\(s\):** List which Business Units will be impacted by this decision.

**What I want to do and why:** Describe the what and why of your proposal.

**Who is the decision maker:** It’s most likely you. Yes, you! If you’ve already [come up with the decision](https://equalexperts.blogin.co/single-post.php?id=62082), the value is less than your BU’s threshold \(£6k in UK\) and the risk to EE is minimal, then it’s definitely you. This also means you’re accountable and responsible for making this decision based on the advice received. If the value is greater than your BUs threshold or there is risk to EE, then you must be appointed by the Exec team or BUL.

Then, ask yourself the following:

**Who do I need feedback from:** This will be a cross section of EE permanent staff and associates. Remember, we are looking for those impacted by the decision and experts in the area. Please share this document with those people, then follow up with one-to-one/one-to-few conversations with those people to explore your proposal further. Record feedback in your AP template document.

**Do I need an AP Governance Group?** For larger or longer running investments a [Governance Group]() is required.

**Next Steps:** Outline what needs to be done in the future to progress your proposal.

**Forecast the cost:** Everything has a cost in time/money, so please provide a rough order of magnitude here. To help with Business Unit cost tracking, separate out the following costs as follows \(excluding GST/VAT\):

* **Investment in employee time**: assume a fixed cost of £500 or €500/day for any UK, Germany or Portugal employee \(other countries are yet to be confirmed\).
* **Investment in cash**: any associate/contractor time \(assume the same cost of £500 or €500/day in the UK\), as well as any other costs that would be invoiced to EE \(e.g. travel, accommodation, shared workspace costs\).

To keep things simple, opportunity cost does _not_ need to be considered \(e.g. where consultants spend time on an AP instead of being client billable\).

**Track the cost:** Costs will be allocated to the Business Unit of the AP decision maker. Actual money spent will be tracked by the Finance team. To facilitate this, please ensure non-billable timesheets and invoices that relate to the AP are clearly linked using the AP ID. Shelagh Jones assigns AP IDs on a monthly basis in [this global tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eeu7q0cStaYkM7iU6JlmCqpwvNpglE7E2C7mbxvtfgc/edit?usp=sharing).

At this stage, we won’t track opportunity cost nor employee time. There’s more info in the [Investment Tracking Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16wbKY9T4hRD2MqpmwTTv20N9q7hDWBygaGw9cqLU1hE/edit?usp=sharing).

**Define the success metrics:** A significant part of the individual and organisational learning we get from a decision is through quantifying its resultant impact.

1. What metrics will quantify the \(positive\) impact of this decision?
2. What are the thresholds for success and failure?
3. When and how will you take measurements?

Having good metrics is important, but they can be hard to define. This [article on good metrics](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-good-metric-bec313bbc8c7) provides useful guidance and the AP Learning Group will be happy to work through the question with you \(make contact with @ap-learning-group in [\#ap-decisions](https://equalexperts.slack.com/messages/CCFLF2KM5)\). In the future, we’ll also be providing exemplar APs to learn from.

### 

**Result:** Documenting this is critical, as it’s the only way to provide transparency to the process and the only way we can collectively learn as an organisation. The decision maker is responsible for updating the result of the proposal until closed.

### 

**Learnings:** Are there things we’d do again, or avoid in the future? Are there learnings to be shared across the organisation?

## Standard Advice and Conventions

After change has settled into the standard working practices it can become ‘standard advice’. Examples of this include:

* Our policies around conferences and training
* Expenses:
  * The typical amount people can spend on a hotel
  * What is considered a valid business expense \(and what is not\)
  * Entertaining clients and teams

If you’re happy working within the framework that the standard advice has created then you don’t need to raise an AP. But if you want to challenge the standard advice, you should consider creating a new AP.

You should record in your decision why you disagree with the conventional way of doing things, so we can update the “standard advice” afterwards to help the next person.

## Tracking the Advice Process

At EE we track each AP in a simple Google sheet.

### Investment Tracking Overview for the Advice Process

* The Advice Process Tracker is the source of reference data needed to determine how to manage each advice process
* The Finance team will track actual money \(cash\) spent using current approval processes.
* Associates’ time that we will be paying for, will be captured using a non-billable timesheet in ETZ or Kimble \(depending on which system the associate is using\).
* All cash costs \(ie. excluding internal staff time\) of APs will be allocated to the Business Unit of the AP decision maker \(this may also be a Global pot, depending on the AP\).
* Employee time will be estimated in the AP, but not tracked.
* Opportunity costs won’t be estimated nor tracked.
* Where there are costs \(including time from associates that are billed to EE\), this data will be provided by the Finance team on a monthly basis.
* Invoices that arise from an AP \(e.g. for an associates non-billable time\) will be used by the Finance Team to report monthly on AP costs. They will be tied to the AP via an AP ID assigned to it when it’s added the [global tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eeu7q0cStaYkM7iU6JlmCqpwvNpglE7E2C7mbxvtfgc/edit?usp=sharing).
* Cost tracking will follow the current model used by finance, where the AP ID is added to any associated invoice for reporting. Every month, Finance will provide a spreadsheet of all AP costs that month.

### Changing the Status of an AP

To Abandon an AP, just post into the channel, your intention to abandon and why. This will be reflected in the tacker.

To Complete an AP you must have

* spent the money \(or enough to have done enough
* Captured lessons learnt and updated the AP result
* Presented at a Show and Tell

### Tracking each AP

Progress has been made on tracking AP with [Advice Process Proposals tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eeu7q0cStaYkM7iU6JlmCqpwvNpglE7E2C7mbxvtfgc) - which is awesome - this enables us to improve our tracking as tweaked below.

#### Categorise the AP

In the Tracker, the CFO will assign a category to the AP, using his judgement but based on the criteria below:

**Decisions**

This describes any AP that is required to meet the immediate needs of the business and is not speculative in nature. For instance “hire 1 recruiter to meet the demands of sold work” or “Get a bigger office because we run out of space”. Those decisions are still important to surface and discuss in the open. But once they have been made, they do not need to be tracked separately as an investment and will be included in the P&L of the business unit.

**Investments**

This is for anything that is seeking an improvement to our business that is speculative. We want to track those investment as a total global investment \(GIT\). This is so we can limit how much money we invest in these speculative initiatives. This is tracked under the “Finance Tracker” tab.

**We distinguish between:**

* Indirect Investment. Any improvement that does not contribute directly to the bottom line, or generate leads or sales. For instance, investing in Airtable or in co-working days to share knowledge.
* Direct Investment. Any thing we do with the explicit goal to contribute directly to the bottom line or generating leads or sales. For instance, having a Pre-Engagment Team or the Healthcare practice, or even hiring a new Sales person.

#### Limiting the total investment pot

Based on the categorisation above, we will constrain the global investment pot to £500K maximum spend between 1st October and 31st March - the end of this fiscal year.
