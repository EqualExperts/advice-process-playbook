## The principles to get behind

There are some key principles and assumptions that underpin the Advice Process – and they run counter to traditional corporate models. It’s important that you \(and your colleagues!\) buy into these if the Advice Process is to succeed.

You need to believe that people are:

* Grown-ups and want to be treated as such.
* Care about doing the right thing for the company.
* Capable of providing insights and perspectives.
* Capable of making decisions.
* Unique and creative thinkers.
* Capable of learning, and up for a challenge.

Let’s be honest – in some organisations, these concepts would be difficult to embed. However, we’re fortunate at Equal Experts in that we’ve long encouraged this kind of thinking; our co-founder Thomas de Cad’oro Granier has long expressed a desire for EE to be a ‘company of grown-ups’, an attitude that naturally dovetails with the kind of thinking above.

Whilst many large companies will talk about similar principles, the proof is in how they are executed. They need to be the reality if the AP is to work.

**Pro tips:**

* People aren’t perfect – we are all fallible, no matter where we fall in the hierarchy or how long we’ve been within the organisation.
* It’s hard to let go as a boss and trust and empower people. Do not underestimate how easy it is to slip back into the old ways
