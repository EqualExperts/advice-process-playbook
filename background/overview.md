## When to use the Advice Process

**Using the Advice Process is all about managing change. So if you’re trying to change something in the organisation, you should consider using the AP.**

If you’re **making a decision that someone else should know about**, consider using the Advice Process.

If you are **trying something for the first time**, consider using the Advice Process. The AP helps us learn, both as individuals and as an organisation. If you want to do something that you’ve not seen done before at EE, or is not considered business-as-usual within the company, consider using the AP. It might seem like a very familiar decision for you, but it’s not just about you; it’s about helping the rest of EE learn.

The AP improves communication and transparency, and clarifies accountability. Ultimately we’d like to see the AP become _**our preferred form of communicating any decisions**_.

The Advice Process should add value, not bureaucracy. If you’re making a decision and don’t see any way the AP will create value – from anyone’s perspective – then don’t use it. If you’re not sure, ask. If you’re still not sure, try. The downside is low, the upside high.

So let’s experiment!
