# Introduction

**We wrote this playbook to share our ongoing experience of a real-world implementation of the Advice Process at Equal Experts, and related non-conventional approaches to running a company.**

This playbook is written for two audiences - people working within the Equal Experts network \(EE\), who want to learn more about the Advice Process \(AP\), and those outside our organisation who are curious to learn more about how it works \(possibly with a view to trying it within their own organisations\).

If you’re in the latter group, you can learn more about Equal Experts at our website, [equalexperts.com](https://equalexperts.com).

As our understanding of how to run EE matures, we’ve come to a point where we’re more confident about presenting some of the less mainstream ways that we work within the network. We’ve long talked about providing a haven or a place where we treat people like grown-ups, but words are wind; these ambitions only become real once you start to change your policies and working practices to align with them.

This playbook reflects on our journey so far, and provides a few hints and tips for any other organisations that may wish to break out of the increasingly outdated management practices that we’re all so used to.

While there are some great books that outline alternative management practices, we’ve found there’s a limited number of real-world examples of performing the changes described at **scale** \(notable exceptions include AES, [Morning Star](http://morningstarco.com/index.cgi?Page=Self-Management) and [Buurtzorg](https://www.buurtzorg.com/about-us/buurtzorgmodel/)\). As Equal Experts’ turnover now passes £100 million, with offices around the world, we hope this playbook will add to the collection of case studies.

The backbone of our management practices is based on the Advice Process as described by Dennis W. Bakke in [Joy at Work: A Revolutionary Approach To Fun on the Job](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/362307.Joy_at_Work). We’ve learnt new things along our journey and so have adapted various parts to suit our needs and particular context.

## What is the Advice Process?

Companies of a certain size need some kind of corporate governance; the Advice Process is ours. It’s an unusual way to approach governance – because it empowers any EE employee to make meaningful decisions, rather than wait to be told what to do \(as with a traditional top-down or consensus-driven arrangement\).

Instead of having to refer ‘up’ all the time when faced with decisions, as its name suggests the Advice Process simply requires people to ask for advice from appropriate colleagues. This should be a tremendously empowering thing for all of us \(especially when we consider that the common alternative is the traditional top-down model, with investment committees, long proposals and 100 hoops to jump through whenever you want to try and use your initiative\).

The Advice Process means that power isn’t held in the hands of an elite few at Equal Experts; decision-making is spread across the organisation. But distributing power across organisations is hard, so it’s up to everyone in EE to make this work. We don’t want to end up as just another consultancy!

### A word of advice

With the Advice Process, before a person can make a decision they must seek advice from affected parties and people with expertise on the matter.

To be clear, it’s _not_ about gaining consensus – rather, it creates a framework which allows people to seek advice, then own and execute on decisions for which they are accountable and responsible for the outcome..

Currently, the AP applies to our UK employees and employees of any other Business Unit \(BU\) that chooses to adopt it. In time, we believe it is important to develop this kind of decision making across EE. It fits with our culture and values. It provides autonomy and treats people like grown-ups. And it enables us to keep a mostly flat hierarchy.

To fulfill its purpose, the Advice Process needs to achieve the following:

1. **Collaboration** - the decision maker needs to actively listen to other people \(both knowledgeable and affected people\) to improve his or her decision. Those people consulted have to actively help the decision maker to make a better decision.
2. **Accountability** - the decision maker needs to be held accountable for their decision by the rest of the organisation.
3. **Transparency** - the AP should bring an increased level of transparency to decision-making across the organisation
4. **Feedback and Learning** - we need to measure the outcome of decisions made via the AP, and learn from our decisions \(both as individuals, and as an organisation\).

_“Advice received must be taken into consideration. The point is not to create a watered-down compromise that accommodates everybody’s wishes. It is about accessing collective wisdom in pursuit of a sound decision. With all the advice and perspectives the decision maker has received, they choose what they believe to be the best course of action.”_

_"It is a misunderstanding that self-management decisions are made by getting everyone to agree, or even involving everyone in the decision. The advice seeker must take all relevant advice into consideration, but can still make the decision. "_

 _–_ [_Reinventing Organizations Wiki_](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making)

## Why we use the Advice Process

We first began experimenting with the AP in April 2016. Around that time, EE’s mission statement read something like this:

_"Equal Experts was created to be a haven where people are comfortable enough to be themselves, in an environment where there is support and mutual respect for you and your peers. In a self-organising environment, autonomy is given but in return we are expected to take personal responsibility and hold ourselves accountable for achieving our mission. Above all, we are expected to do the right thing by your colleagues and customers."_

Of course, mission statements are only useful if they actually drive behaviours and instruct involved parties on how to operate the organisation.

Our statement touched on a number of areas, including company policies and organisational structure. But at the heart of it all is how we make decisions within Equal Experts, and who makes them.

We needed a framework to guide this decision-making process; the Advice Process is that framework. In other words, it’s the method by which we ensure we are actually living our values.

## Who is this playbook for?

It’s for anyone that’s interested in the Advice Process – both inside Equal Experts and outside.

**Inside EE?**

A key reason this playbook exists is to support employees inside Equal Experts and provide an overview of the processes we use, so new starters can gain context and support. It’s also for old hands who want a refresher on how to do things \(not everyone will need to run an AP regularly\).

If you make decisions in your day to day job \(which we all do\) this will be relevant to you. It’s more than just seeking advice – it's about corporate governance \(in an accessible, non-boring way, hopefully\). It’s intended to help us manage ongoing change while continuing to run the company in an un-corporate way – and keep the network recognisably ‘us’ as we continue to grow.

**Outside EE?**

It’s our hope that this playbook might also provide a template or framework for any other people and/or organisations who are **outside** the Equal Experts network, who are looking for a real-world guide to implementing the Advice Process \(or something like it\). At the very least, hopefully some element of our experience may inform your own efforts.

## Using this Playbook

The Playbook is broken down into several sections.

**Background**

An overview of the Advice Process and why we think this system of management works, plus an outline of advantages we’ve seen and some pitfalls to avoid. Read this section if you are new to the Advice Process and want to gain some general context about what it is, and what it isn’t.

**How the Advice Process works**

A more detailed look at each step in the process as followed by EE, together with some relevant theory, real-world experiences and tips. If you’re an EE employee, this is the process to follow to get investment into ideas and how you make change within; if you’re external, this is our real world example of the AP in action.

**Run an AP**

This section is based on the practicalities - detailing what you actually need to do to run an AP, and in what order,

**AP Housekeeping**

In this section, you’ll find useful templates and a rundown of the various Slack channels we use to administer and discuss APs within EE.

**Even more AP**

For those researching the possibility of adopting their own Advice Process, or just those who can’t get enough of innovative business management \(hey, it happens\), we’ve shared some of the reference material that’s informed us over the last few years. You’ll also find ways to contact us to discuss all this in more detail, or let us know what you think of this playbook \(we’d love to hear from you!\).
