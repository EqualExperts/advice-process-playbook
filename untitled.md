In an extreme command and control environment, when to jump and how high comes from the central command. Or, put another way, the flow of ideas originated from the command end of the system.

In contrast, highly decentralised hierarchies see ideas flow from all over the network. The idea to jump \(and how high\) might come from central command, but the idea to stand on one leg might come from elsewhere in the overall hierarchy \(jumping wasn’t the right thing to do this time\).

At Equal Experts, we want to drive towards ideas flowing from all over the network, and the Advice Process helps us to achieve this. Having a self-appointed decision maker for initiatives under a certain impact threshold is one way this works, as it helps to encourage ideas to be tested without being stopped by higher powers. For higher impact items, it is rare \(but possible\) that an initiative is stopped while confirming the Decision Maker \(the next step\).

## Confirming the decision maker

We don’t want Equal Experts to be a business where people check in their minds at the door; we want people to be engaged. After all, it’s the quality of decisions that determine the success or failure of any organisation – people are at their most creative and motivated to make good decisions when they have real control and responsibility.

There are still appointed leaders within EE – like the Exec Team and the Business Unit Leads \(BULs\) – but they don’t make all the decisions. Rather, their focus is to enable others to make decisions safely, based on a common set of data accessible to all. They do make one very important set of decisions, however: to confirm the decision maker for APs covering high value items in their area, on different decisions and projects.

The Exec / BUL of a team confirms the decision maker; it’s then that person’s decision, and they are accountable for the results and responsible for the consequences. This is because if the person who makes the decision doesn’t have any responsibility, the decision doesn’t mean anything.

### Who appoints the Decision Maker: a quick guide

* _For low-value decisions under a certain threshold \(outlined in the table below\), any employee who is part of a Business Unit \(BU\) that’s adopted the AP can appoint themselves as decision maker._
* _Above the value threshold and below £20,000, if an AP impacts a single BU, then the relevant Business Unit Lead \(BUL\) appoints the decision maker._
* _For any decision that spans across Business Units, or not covered by the two points above, the Exec Team appoints the decision maker._

### 

### High value/large impact decisions

As outlined above, the decision maker for higher value or larger impact decisions, needs to be confirmed either by the BUL or by the Exec Team. Execs will consider APs that affect more than one BU, while BULs will consider APs that impacting only their BU.

The outcome will be one of the following:

* The person that raised the AP originally is confirmed to be the decision maker. A variant on this is that the exec/BUL confirms the original person, but asks for the scope/cost of the AP to be reduced.
* Alternatively, another person takes over the AP to decide on the outcome. This new person could be the Exec or the BUL, but we recommend avoiding this if possible, so other people can be exposed to larger decisions.

**Please note:** We want APs to be as short as possible - both to encourage small steps, accelerated learning and a short payback period 1-3 months is preferable, sometimes we will tolerate up to 6 months.

### Value threshold by Business Unit

Under the listed threshold, any employee can appoint themselves the decision maker \(unless the decision is deemed to have a bigger impact, or affect more than a single BU\).

| **BU** | **BUL** | **Value GBP** | **Local Currency Value** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| UK \(London / SW / North\) |  | 6,000 GBP | 6,000 GBP |
| UKSW | Andy Kemp | 6,000 GBP | 6,000 GBP |
| UK North | Andy Goundry | 6,000 GBP | 6,000 GBP |
| Germany | Nuno Marques | circa 5.5K GBP | 6,000 EUROs |
| Bengaluru | Vishwas Bhagath | circa 1.7k GBP | 1.5 lakhs |
| Pune | Ashish Jagtap | circa 1.7k GBP | 1.5 lakhs |
| ANZ | Bethan Timmins | circa 5.5K GBP | 10,000 AUD/NZD |
| US | Ryan Sikorsky | circa 5K GBP | 6,000 USD |
| Portugal | Ryan Bayly | circa 5.5K GBP | 3750 EUROs |
| South Africa | Brian Blignaut | circa 3K GBP | 50,000 ZAR |

### WIP Limits

One person can only be the decision maker for 2 on-going AP at any given time. If you want to open another AP and already have 2 APs in flight, you will have to abandon or complete existing ones, before opening another.

### 

### Transparency of Appointments

For transparency, we have a slack channel \(\#ap-bul\), where BULs are required to update the channel with all their appointments of decision makers, for those decisions above the threshold of their Business Unit.

Please update the channel each time you appoint a decision maker, along with some comment on why they are a good appointment with respect to the specific decision concerned.

### Appointing the right decision maker

Choosing who the decision maker should be is not always straightforward – just because someone has a good idea, it doesn’t mean they are the right person to take it forward. When appointing \(or self-appointing\) a decision maker, the key considerations should be:

* **Empathy.** Can this person see the problem from other people’s perspective? Are they a good listener? Do they enter conversations with an open mind?
* **Values**. Does this person understand the values of EE? Do they connect with our ‘Why’ at a deep level? Does their behaviour exemplify EE values in a consistent manner – day in, day out?
* **Tenacity.** Willingness to drive the decision to a conclusion – will this person see the decision through to the end?
* **Proximity.** Who’s close to the issue / has situational awareness? Are they well acquainted with the context, the day-to-day details? Do they have skin in the game? If the decision directly affects the decision-maker, then the outcome is no longer abstract. They don’t just want to get it right for its own sake, they want to get it right because what happens is going to impact them directly.
* **Perspective.** Proximity matters, but so does perspective. Often you need to be able to see the big picture and how this decision fits into the wider context. We have a scarce resource in both time and money – do they understand this? Sometimes an outside perspective can be just as valuable.
* **Experience.** Has this person had experience of making similar decisions? What were the consequences of those decisions?
* **Wisdom and track record.** What kinds of decisions has this person made in other areas? Do they have a history of good decisions? Do you have confidence in this person?
* **Responsibility**. Decisions have consequences, and decision-makers should be held accountable for theirs. At the same time, nobody is right all the time. The most important part of any decision is that the decision maker fully engages with the advice process, not just that he or she gets is “right”.

### Spreading decision making across the organisation

It’s perfectly OK to ask someone else to take the decision. It may well be the case that there are people who are closer to the problem that would be a better decision maker.

In order to spread the responsibilities around, people who already make many decisions at EE should seek other people that are willing to take ownership of a specific decision and let them.

We want to move away from a model where a few people are making most decisions. This is a step- by-step process that requires our active participation.

As long as other people are willing to own and implement a particular decision, they can and should be entrusted with it.

## Advice & Analysis

### Asking for advice

Decision makers are free to gather advice in whatever fashion they think is appropriate.  
Wherever possible, we recommend asking for advice as part of a conversation – whether it’s face to face \(ideally\) or Slack/phone, one-on-one or in carefully moderated small meetings. This is because we want people to have a meaningful two-way exchange, in order to increase:

* Our sense of community and the richness of our peer relationships \(the act of saying “I need you” is powerful\)
* The learning opportunity, especially for the decision maker \(discussing the pros & cons of their decisions with other people\) 

For the same reasons we’ve touched on above, we recommend to not use electronic tools to receive the advice itself, whenever possible. Instead, tools should be used to moderate the process and to record the decision \(for transparency and learning purposes\).

People should use their best judgement in order to decide who is best to ask advice from. We recommend to never ask everyone in the office for their advice, even if the decision is wide-ranging enough to warrant it. This is true even if the decision does affect everyone.

Why? Because we want the decision maker to feel accountable for their decision, as well as avoiding the trap of falling into consensus-driven decision making.

Instead, we recommend asking a representative sample of people in different roles \(both consultants and business operations\), with different levels of experience and tenure \(both old hands and new\). We also recommend recording who is asked, so we don’t end up asking the same people over and over again.

### Managing Scarce Resources

Resources have to be used wisely, and the decision to proceed needs to carefully take this into account.

### Practical advice, borne from experience

1. **Get feedback on your AP doc before publishing it on Slack.** A recommended approach is to only publish it once you’ve received feedback from those you’ve asked for advice, so you’re reasonably confident with your potential decision \(if you opt to use a dedicated slack channel to gather feedback, please use the prefix _ap-\*_, as per our Slack [naming guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hdnf_em4e7h8qIi-ye0_8djwulHuSUerIxjthh1JtpE/edit)\).
2. **Timebox how long you’ll receive/process unsolicited feedback for.** After you publish your AP on Slack, give yourself one week \(for example\) to receive feedback from people you might not have considered to ask. How you process people’s feedback is entirely up to you though, because you’re the decision maker. You’re also accountable for the decision, so take due care and consideration in handling all feedback.
3. **Make really fast decisions \(in less than an hour\) by using the** [**AP template**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j9wXFM8-UGIYMdaHACBvs-FYLXJSwxjEgAmHtMU89lw/edit) **as a checklist for actions you need to take, then write it up and publish it afterwards.** We don’t want bureaucracy at EE, but we also want to avoid people shooting from the hip. We expect people to carefully consider the consequences of their decisions. The Advice Process does not add effort; it provides some of the necessary checks and balances that replace top-down decision making and potential micro-management.

### Hints & Tips

What are some of the patterns for making good decisions?

#### Making good decisions is like playing poker

_“Poker is a game of incomplete information. It is a game of decision-making under conditions of uncertainty over time. Valuable information remains hidden, and there is an element of luck in any outcome. You can make the best possible decision at every point and still lose the hand, because you don’t know what new cards will be dealt and revealed. Once the game is finished and you try to learn from the results, separating the quality of your decisions from the influence of luck is difficult.”_

_Paraphrased from Duke, Annie. Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts \(pp. 30-31\). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition._

#### 

#### Advice from a group: making it better than the sum of its individuals

The advice from a group can be better than the sum of its individuals, but only if you seek advice from the _right_ team.

We can improve the quality of decisions by promoting exploratory thought. So don’t just select people who are going to agree with you!

_“Complex and open-minded thought is most likely to be activated when decision makers learn prior to forming any opinions that they will be accountable to an audience \(a\) whose views are unknown, \(b\) who is interested in accuracy, \(c\) who is reasonably well-informed, and \(d\) who has a legitimate reason for inquiring into the reasons behind participants’ judgments / choices.”_

[_Lerner and Tetlock 2002_](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1e30/cd74414cbe0f24e03cf10362fc4b7372e885.pdf)

Introduce diversity to challenge bias thinking. As Jonathan Haidt points out in his book [_The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Righteous_Mind):

_“If you put individuals together in the right way, such that some individuals can use their reasoning powers to disconfirm the claims of others, and all individuals feel some common bond or shared fate that allows them to interact civilly, you can create a group that ends up producing good reasoning as an emergent property of the social system. This is why it’s so important to have intellectual and ideological diversity within any group or institution whose goal is to find truth.”_

Combine these two ideas and you get a blueprint for the type of people in a group you should seek advice from.

1. A focus on accuracy \(over confirmation bias\), which includes rewarding truth-seeking, objectivity, and open-mindedness within the group;
2. Accountability, for which members have advance notice; and
3. Openness to a diversity of ideas.

An agreement along these lines creates a common bond and shared fate among members, allowing the group to produce sound reasoning.

## Making the Decision

If you’ve done everything as we’ve set out, this part should be pretty easy!. Make a call, go on …

## Measuring the Decision

Now comes the crucial feedback loop we prize, if we are to make progress. Build/Measure/Learn - then rinse and repeat.

Of course, this is easy to write, but the hardest thing to really crack. At this point at EE, we still haven’t really cracked this in order to get real data on the majority of our APs. So what follows is more to state where we are aiming for, rather than what we have accomplished!

In our [Advice Process template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1j9wXFM8-UGIYMdaHACBvs-FYLXJSwxjEgAmHtMU89lw) \(see the AP Housekeeping section\), we have an area titled success metrics. The purpose of this is threefold:

1. Improve the quality of the thinking that goes into making the decision.
2. Provide a starting position, or anchor, for the build / measure / learn loop.
3. Help to de-bias future decisions, based on the result of this decision.

### Measuring impact

A significant part of the individual and organisational learning we get from a decision is through quantifying the impact of the decision. To help do this, we ask for the key hypothesis \(or Objective\) and associated tests \(or key results\) to be defined in each AP. We can use these to either test the outcome directly, or \(more likely\) show progress towards the outcome, by measuring leading indicators.

Be specific about:

1. What metrics will quantify the \(positive\) impact of this decision?
2. What are the thresholds for success and failure?
3. When and how will you take measurements?

### Hints & Tips

**Resulting correlation does not imply causation:** don’t create an overly tight relationship between results and decision quality. Just because you had a good \(or bad\) outcome, it doesn’t follow that it was a good \(or bad\) decision. It could just be down to dumb luck \(see that earlier reference to poker\).

**Break down the decision into a series of small steps**: then measure as you go. At decision time, you’re often information poor. More often than not you can break down a big decision into a series of smaller ones. If you gain new information and you end up abandoning or pivoting based on this new information, congratulations – you’ve just made a good decision.

## Governance for long-running initiatives

### Advice Process Governance

We’re investing in a number of long-running initiatives that we believe will have a positive impact on our future. These include things like new clients for existing services, completely new services for existing clients, increased visibility and industry awareness, as well as new offices in new locations. All these initiatives have been through the advice process and have people and funds committed to delivering them.

This is the simple, lightweight governance model we use to support these initiatives. It’s based on the belief that validated learning is at the heart of what we do, where an initiative has a clear vision, a governing group and agreed metrics and timescales.

Our governance is more lean start-up than corporate take-over. Its design is based heavily on the Eric Ries book [_The Startup Way_](http://www.thestartupway.com). The rule of thumb for when to use it? Any long-running AP; or any AP with a value greater than £10k. Any practice or Business Unit is required to set up a governance board.

Here’s our governance set-up:

![](.gitbook/assets/18.png)

### Governance Group Mandate

We improve the thinking of decision-makers when they are accountable to a group whose interest is in accuracy.

The governance group should:

1. Not take on Operational functions.
2. Meet at least once a quarter \(and not more than once a month\).
3. Consist of two or more people, depending on the scale of the initiative it’s overseeing..
4. Establish a chairperson to ensure that meetings happen, are minuted and reported to the AP channel.
5. The chair is responsible for following the process \(e.g. running the checkpoint meeting\).
6. The Initiative Lead determines if the AP continues.

The intent is that the people doing the governance are different from initiative to initiative. And people are not part of more than two governance processes at any point in time..

#### Hints & Tips

**What would make a good critical friend?** At least one of your critical friends needs to understand the build &gt; measure &gt; learn loop \(and be able to challenge the measures\), and at least one should have some experience in the domain \(e.g. if setting up a new office, get someone who has done it before\). Critical friends need to be motivated, excited and/or interested in the project and able to assess if the initiative is in line with the company's purpose.

**Can anyone be a critical friend?** Yes – including non-permanent staff, or even people outside EE. But the initiative lead needs to agree the person with the BUL or Exec.

**What does the critical friend get out of this?** Experience in helping to run these types of processes, and an opportunity to get involved in initiatives that they might be interested in.

**How do you select a critical friend?** Work out who would be good based on the above, and start having a conversation!

**What happens if I lose one of my critical friends?** Initially, try and recruit another. If you can’t, then have a conversation with the BUL or Exec. If they are leaving because they don’t buy into the project anymore, this may be a sign that the project is not viable.

**What if the critical friends disagree with the initiative lead’s view on something critical – such as whether to continue investing?** The critical friend should quit. This should prompt a conversation with the BUL or Exec as to why it happened.

**How do I know when to stop the governance process?** When investment stops, or the initiative concerned is embedded into BAU \(as agreed by the governance group\).

**What if the initiative fails?** Failures aren’t fun, but they also don’t matter. What does matter is that we continue to experiment, because “companies that don’t embrace failure eventually get into a desperate position, where the only thing they can do is make a ‘Hail Mary’ bet at the very end of their corporate existence. We don’t believe in bet-the-company bets”. - _Jeff Bezos, Amazon Founder/CEO_

**Can I change my critical friend?** Yes, but the new arrangement needs to be agreed by the BUL or Exec, and the other critical friends.

Run your own AP

**A step-by-step process & templates to run your own AP**

_\* please note that some links will require EE credentials to access_

1. Search EE’s [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com), Slack and [Blogin](https://equalexperts.blogin.co) for previous documents and blogs that relate to your decision. This might well turn up prior decisions, discussions, guidelines and APs that you can learn from. All APs are in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m-2TFRzgoCLVrGppyIFxi8G-9DExv5gG), and are listed [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eeu7q0cStaYkM7iU6JlmCqpwvNpglE7E2C7mbxvtfgc).
2. Use the AP template, filling in the sections described below \([click this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j9wXFM8-UGIYMdaHACBvs-FYLXJSwxjEgAmHtMU89lw/copy?copyDestination=1m-2TFRzgoCLVrGppyIFxi8G-9DExv5gG) to make a copy of the template\).
3. Move the completed document into the [Advice Process -&gt; Proposals folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m-2TFRzgoCLVrGppyIFxi8G-9DExv5gG) and share it with the people you need feedback from.
4. Share the doc in the [\#ap-decisions](https://equalexperts.slack.com/messages/CCFLF2KM5) Slack channel. You can do this before, during or after you’ve received feedback.

Note that it’s important we don’t bog ourselves down in bureaucracy. The Advice Process is only required for a decision that is [useful for others to know about](https://equalexperts.blogin.co/single-post.php?id=62082).

There’s no need to record decisions where the following points apply:

* There is limited impact and limited investment, AND
* You’re following a mature set of guidelines \(e.g. [training and conferences](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-CbaP254Tw62C7EtqvgXOKW2nw0sOjivyw4Aj9xuJvY/edit?usp=sharing)\) that you agree apply to your circumstances.

For everything else, please capture your decision – at the latest after you’ve completed the Advice Process. Be sure to record the following:

**Proposal title:** Decision headline

**Impacted Business Unit\(s\):** List which Business Units will be impacted by this decision.

**What I want to do and why:** Describe the what and why of your proposal.

**Who is the decision maker:** It’s most likely you. Yes, you! If you’ve already [come up with the decision](https://equalexperts.blogin.co/single-post.php?id=62082), the value is less than your BU’s threshold \(£6k in UK\) and the risk to EE is minimal, then it’s definitely you. This also means you’re accountable and responsible for making this decision based on the advice received. If the value is greater than your BUs threshold or there is risk to EE, then you must be appointed by the Exec team or BUL.

Then, ask yourself the following:

**Who do I need feedback from:** This will be a cross section of EE permanent staff and associates. Remember, we are looking for those impacted by the decision and experts in the area. Please share this document with those people, then follow up with one-to-one/one-to-few conversations with those people to explore your proposal further. Record feedback in your AP template document.

**Do I need an AP Governance Group?** For larger or longer running investments a [Governance Group]() is required.

**Next Steps:** Outline what needs to be done in the future to progress your proposal.

**Forecast the cost:** Everything has a cost in time/money, so please provide a rough order of magnitude here. To help with Business Unit cost tracking, separate out the following costs as follows \(excluding GST/VAT\):

* **Investment in employee time**: assume a fixed cost of £500 or €500/day for any UK, Germany or Portugal employee \(other countries are yet to be confirmed\).
* **Investment in cash**: any associate/contractor time \(assume the same cost of £500 or €500/day in the UK\), as well as any other costs that would be invoiced to EE \(e.g. travel, accommodation, shared workspace costs\).

To keep things simple, opportunity cost does _not_ need to be considered \(e.g. where consultants spend time on an AP instead of being client billable\).

**Track the cost:** Costs will be allocated to the Business Unit of the AP decision maker. Actual money spent will be tracked by the Finance team. To facilitate this, please ensure non-billable timesheets and invoices that relate to the AP are clearly linked using the AP ID. Shelagh Jones assigns AP IDs on a monthly basis in [this global tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eeu7q0cStaYkM7iU6JlmCqpwvNpglE7E2C7mbxvtfgc/edit?usp=sharing).

At this stage, we won’t track opportunity cost nor employee time. There’s more info in the [Investment Tracking Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16wbKY9T4hRD2MqpmwTTv20N9q7hDWBygaGw9cqLU1hE/edit?usp=sharing).

**Define the success metrics:** A significant part of the individual and organisational learning we get from a decision is through quantifying its resultant impact.

1. What metrics will quantify the \(positive\) impact of this decision?
2. What are the thresholds for success and failure?
3. When and how will you take measurements?

Having good metrics is important, but they can be hard to define. This [article on good metrics](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-good-metric-bec313bbc8c7) provides useful guidance and the AP Learning Group will be happy to work through the question with you \(make contact with @ap-learning-group in [\#ap-decisions](https://equalexperts.slack.com/messages/CCFLF2KM5)\). In the future, we’ll also be providing exemplar APs to learn from.

### 

**Result:** Documenting this is critical, as it’s the only way to provide transparency to the process and the only way we can collectively learn as an organisation. The decision maker is responsible for updating the result of the proposal until closed.

### 

**Learnings:** Are there things we’d do again, or avoid in the future? Are there learnings to be shared across the organisation?

## Standard Advice and Conventions

After change has settled into the standard working practices it can become ‘standard advice’. Examples of this include:

* Our policies around conferences and training
* Expenses:
  * The typical amount people can spend on a hotel
  * What is considered a valid business expense \(and what is not\)
  * Entertaining clients and teams

If you’re happy working within the framework that the standard advice has created then you don’t need to raise an AP. But if you want to challenge the standard advice, you should consider creating a new AP.

You should record in your decision why you disagree with the conventional way of doing things, so we can update the “standard advice” afterwards to help the next person.

## Tracking the Advice Process

At EE we track each AP in a simple Google sheet.

### Investment Tracking Overview for the Advice Process

* The Advice Process Tracker is the source of reference data needed to determine how to manage each advice process
* The Finance team will track actual money \(cash\) spent using current approval processes.
* Associates’ time that we will be paying for, will be captured using a non-billable timesheet in ETZ or Kimble \(depending on which system the associate is using\).
* All cash costs \(ie. excluding internal staff time\) of APs will be allocated to the Business Unit of the AP decision maker \(this may also be a Global pot, depending on the AP\).
* Employee time will be estimated in the AP, but not tracked.
* Opportunity costs won’t be estimated nor tracked.
* Where there are costs \(including time from associates that are billed to EE\), this data will be provided by the Finance team on a monthly basis.
* Invoices that arise from an AP \(e.g. for an associates non-billable time\) will be used by the Finance Team to report monthly on AP costs. They will be tied to the AP via an AP ID assigned to it when it’s added the [global tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eeu7q0cStaYkM7iU6JlmCqpwvNpglE7E2C7mbxvtfgc/edit?usp=sharing).
* Cost tracking will follow the current model used by finance, where the AP ID is added to any associated invoice for reporting. Every month, Finance will provide a spreadsheet of all AP costs that month.

### Changing the Status of an AP

To Abandon an AP, just post into the channel, your intention to abandon and why. This will be reflected in the tacker.

To Complete an AP you must have

* spent the money \(or enough to have done enough
* Captured lessons learnt and updated the AP result
* Presented at a Show and Tell

### Tracking each AP

Progress has been made on tracking AP with [Advice Process Proposals tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eeu7q0cStaYkM7iU6JlmCqpwvNpglE7E2C7mbxvtfgc) - which is awesome - this enables us to improve our tracking as tweaked below.

#### Categorise the AP

In the Tracker, the CFO will assign a category to the AP, using his judgement but based on the criteria below:

**Decisions**

This describes any AP that is required to meet the immediate needs of the business and is not speculative in nature. For instance “hire 1 recruiter to meet the demands of sold work” or “Get a bigger office because we run out of space”. Those decisions are still important to surface and discuss in the open. But once they have been made, they do not need to be tracked separately as an investment and will be included in the P&L of the business unit.

**Investments**

This is for anything that is seeking an improvement to our business that is speculative. We want to track those investment as a total global investment \(GIT\). This is so we can limit how much money we invest in these speculative initiatives. This is tracked under the “Finance Tracker” tab.

**We distinguish between:**

* Indirect Investment. Any improvement that does not contribute directly to the bottom line, or generate leads or sales. For instance, investing in Airtable or in co-working days to share knowledge.
* Direct Investment. Any thing we do with the explicit goal to contribute directly to the bottom line or generating leads or sales. For instance, having a Pre-Engagment Team or the Healthcare practice, or even hiring a new Sales person.

#### Limiting the total investment pot

Based on the categorisation above, we will constrain the global investment pot to £500K maximum spend between 1st October and 31st March - the end of this fiscal year.

AP Housekeeping

While we do our best to keep our processes as light as possible, we do need some. The following section describes the core documentation that we use to run our Advice Process at Equal Experts.

### Documents and templates

### 

#### Google Documents

**Advice Process Template:** The basic outline the provides the types of data we look to capture when creating an AP \(we ran through this in section 4 - Run your own AP\).

**Advice Process Drive:** A Google Drive folder, containing all historic and current APs.

**Advice Process Tracker:** Lists all APs created, alongside relevant data \(e.g. Decision Maker, value, tracked monthly spend\)

#### Slack channels

We use Slack intensively in Equal Experts – so it’s the natural choice for us to communicate information about the Advice Process, too.

We have the following channels set up to help move everything along:

* **\#ap\_learning\_group** – the global governance group of the Advice Process. Each country has its own learning group to aid with the roll-out and ongoing improvement of the process. You’ll find more info on this later in this section.
* **\#ap-decisions** – a global channel, where all Advice Processes and associated updates are published \(including meeting minutes from governance groups\).
* **\#ap-bul** – a place for Business Unit Leads to discuss and share appointments of AP decision makers and other related items.
* **\#ap-operations** – a place to discuss the day-to-day operations of the advice process.
* **\#ap-XXX** – when people create an advice process they will often create a temporary channel to discuss it with interested parties. This is not mandatory, but if you do, this is the naming format to use.

#### Monthly Show & Tell

Every month we run a show and tell, where people who have recently published APs in the \#ap-decisions channel take a 5-minute slot to present and discuss their specific AP. The purpose of the show and tell is to aid accountability and transparency – and most importantly, to share any learning along the way.

#### Standard AP checklist

These are the required processes for a standard AP:

1. Fill in the AP template
2. Post it in the \#ap-decisions Slack channel \(this may be after the decision is made\)
3. Update progress, material change or closure of the AP in the template.
4. Attend the Show & Tell when AP is published.

## Advice Process Learning Group

Using the Advice Process requires changes in behaviour and culture, and thus needs a little help to keep things moving along! We’ve found it useful to have a small group \(2-4 people\) focused on advocating and advancing usage of the AP. We call this the AP Learning Group. Each Business Unit that runs the AP is encouraged to have its own Learning Group, as well as a global group with representatives from across the regions.

### 

#### Who’s in the group?

Groups are managed locally – so contact your BUL to find out who is on your local group. The global group group is currently composed of: [Dave Hewett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-hewett-b97609/), [Thomas Granier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasgranier/), [Lyndsay Prewer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lyndsp/) and [Chris Cobb](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-cobb-88981a1/).

We intend to add/rotate more people into the Learning Group in future. If you have any questions and/or wish to take part, please contact your BUL or one of the names above. The main criterion for joining the AP Learning Group is a passion to drive the Advice Process forward.

#### Why’s the Learning Group needed?

We want to actively learn from the process, and learn from our mistakes. This is the first and main role of this group – to collect practical knowledge about the Advice Process so we can get better at it. Based on what we learn, we will seek to improve how we use the Advice Process at EE \(we understand that the Advice Process is initially confusing for many, and feels unnatural to most – especially those used to top-down decision making!\).

We meet at regular intervals to debate what’s working and what isn't, based on all the decisions going through the Advice Process.

Rest assured, we’re not looking to catch out people who are “doing it wrong”; we just aim to identify emerging good practices that we can share with everyone.

We’ll also use our learning to rollout better training for the Advice Process in due course. We really want to provide more comprehensive training around the Advice Process, but we need to better understand the user journey before we can do it properly.

So far, we’ve made good progress on how to explain the journey up to making a decision. We now need to learn more around what’s happening after the initial decision. In time, governance, feedback and learning from our decisions will improve the collective knowledge of the organisation.

#### Coaching people through the Advice Process

We appreciate that completing the advice process can feel like a daunting experience. The second role of the Learning Group is to act as a sounding board – we want to help everyone understand how, when and why they should use it \(this playbook is just one aspect of that\).

The people in the AP Learning Group will happily volunteer their time to coach anyone through the advice process, if they feel they would benefit from some support.

Coaching does not extend to executing on the decision, but it means you’ll have someone to ask questions while you go through the process. Asking for coaching is entirely optional, and up to the individual submitting the process.

Some example reasons why you might want to ask for some coaching:

* If you aren't sure who to ask for advice on the decision;
* If you aren't sure whether something should be an advice process or not;
* You want help on how best to use the Google Doc proposal template;
* You want help thinking about how to measure the results of the decision.

It’s important to understand we are all learning about this together - we do not have all the answers - sometimes our coaching could be leading you down the wrong path, feel free to disregard it!

#### What the Learning Group is not

* A crutch – we don’t want to hand-hold people, just help them get on with it
* A secret trove of knowledge – we don’t want to hoard information. If you have a question, put it on the [\#ap-decisions](https://equalexperts.slack.com/messages/CCFLF2KM5) Slack channel so we can answer it for everyone to see. If you’d rather speak privately first, please take the time to write up what you learn on Slack afterwards. We will try to disseminate info as much as possible, but if you help it’s going to be more effective.
* A conflict resolution board. Even if we are happy to discuss issues, the purpose of this group is not to resolve conflict.
* A judging panel. We’re not looking to catch out people who are “doing it wrong”, we’re seeking emerging good practices to improve the process.

#### Learning for the long term

We want to stress that the Advice Process is not a fad; we’re not doing this just because Thomas read ["Reinventing Organisations"](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/) a year ago. While it’s no panacea and might even be replaced by something else eventually, at this point we believe the Advice Process is an important way to help _all_ of us learn how to make decisions in an alternative way to the traditional top down model. We need to learn this not just as individuals but also as an entire organisation.

This learning is a key step as we evolve towards self-management, which is a key part of our [long term strategy](https://docs.google.com/a/equalexperts.com/presentation/d/15eoNS1VHNGzoNFBL8Ikt0cwR7dUpn6m-xumdX_jQ27w/edit?usp=sharing).
