Run your own AP

**A step-by-step process & templates to run your own AP**

_\* please note that some links will require EE credentials to access_

1. Search EE’s [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com), Slack and [Blogin](https://equalexperts.blogin.co) for previous documents and blogs that relate to your decision. This might well turn up prior decisions, discussions, guidelines and APs that you can learn from. All APs are in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m-2TFRzgoCLVrGppyIFxi8G-9DExv5gG), and are listed [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eeu7q0cStaYkM7iU6JlmCqpwvNpglE7E2C7mbxvtfgc).
2. Use the AP template, filling in the sections described below \([click this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j9wXFM8-UGIYMdaHACBvs-FYLXJSwxjEgAmHtMU89lw/copy?copyDestination=1m-2TFRzgoCLVrGppyIFxi8G-9DExv5gG) to make a copy of the template\).
3. Move the completed document into the [Advice Process -&gt; Proposals folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m-2TFRzgoCLVrGppyIFxi8G-9DExv5gG) and share it with the people you need feedback from.
4. Share the doc in the [\#ap-decisions](https://equalexperts.slack.com/messages/CCFLF2KM5) Slack channel. You can do this before, during or after you’ve received feedback.

Note that it’s important we don’t bog ourselves down in bureaucracy. The Advice Process is only required for a decision that is [useful for others to know about](https://equalexperts.blogin.co/single-post.php?id=62082).

There’s no need to record decisions where the following points apply:

* There is limited impact and limited investment, AND
* You’re following a mature set of guidelines \(e.g. [training and conferences](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-CbaP254Tw62C7EtqvgXOKW2nw0sOjivyw4Aj9xuJvY/edit?usp=sharing)\) that you agree apply to your circumstances.

For everything else, please capture your decision – at the latest after you’ve completed the Advice Process. Be sure to record the following:

**Proposal title:** Decision headline

**Impacted Business Unit\(s\):** List which Business Units will be impacted by this decision.

**What I want to do and why:** Describe the what and why of your proposal.

**Who is the decision maker:** It’s most likely you. Yes, you! If you’ve already [come up with the decision](https://equalexperts.blogin.co/single-post.php?id=62082), the value is less than your BU’s threshold \(£6k in UK\) and the risk to EE is minimal, then it’s definitely you. This also means you’re accountable and responsible for making this decision based on the advice received. If the value is greater than your BUs threshold or there is risk to EE, then you must be appointed by the Exec team or BUL.

Then, ask yourself the following:

**Who do I need feedback from:** This will be a cross section of EE permanent staff and associates. Remember, we are looking for those impacted by the decision and experts in the area. Please share this document with those people, then follow up with one-to-one/one-to-few conversations with those people to explore your proposal further. Record feedback in your AP template document.

**Do I need an AP Governance Group?** For larger or longer running investments a [Governance Group]() is required.

**Next Steps:** Outline what needs to be done in the future to progress your proposal.

**Forecast the cost:** Everything has a cost in time/money, so please provide a rough order of magnitude here. To help with Business Unit cost tracking, separate out the following costs as follows \(excluding GST/VAT\):

* **Investment in employee time**: assume a fixed cost of £500 or €500/day for any UK, Germany or Portugal employee \(other countries are yet to be confirmed\).
* **Investment in cash**: any associate/contractor time \(assume the same cost of £500 or €500/day in the UK\), as well as any other costs that would be invoiced to EE \(e.g. travel, accommodation, shared workspace costs\).

To keep things simple, opportunity cost does _not_ need to be considered \(e.g. where consultants spend time on an AP instead of being client billable\).

**Track the cost:** Costs will be allocated to the Business Unit of the AP decision maker. Actual money spent will be tracked by the Finance team. To facilitate this, please ensure non-billable timesheets and invoices that relate to the AP are clearly linked using the AP ID. Shelagh Jones assigns AP IDs on a monthly basis in [this global tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eeu7q0cStaYkM7iU6JlmCqpwvNpglE7E2C7mbxvtfgc/edit?usp=sharing).

At this stage, we won’t track opportunity cost nor employee time. There’s more info in the [Investment Tracking Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16wbKY9T4hRD2MqpmwTTv20N9q7hDWBygaGw9cqLU1hE/edit?usp=sharing).

**Define the success metrics:** A significant part of the individual and organisational learning we get from a decision is through quantifying its resultant impact.

1. What metrics will quantify the \(positive\) impact of this decision?
2. What are the thresholds for success and failure?
3. When and how will you take measurements?

Having good metrics is important, but they can be hard to define. This [article on good metrics](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-good-metric-bec313bbc8c7) provides useful guidance and the AP Learning Group will be happy to work through the question with you \(make contact with @ap-learning-group in [\#ap-decisions](https://equalexperts.slack.com/messages/CCFLF2KM5)\). In the future, we’ll also be providing exemplar APs to learn from.

### 

**Result:** Documenting this is critical, as it’s the only way to provide transparency to the process and the only way we can collectively learn as an organisation. The decision maker is responsible for updating the result of the proposal until closed.

### 

**Learnings:** Are there things we’d do again, or avoid in the future? Are there learnings to be shared across the organisation?

## Standard Advice and Conventions

After change has settled into the standard working practices it can become ‘standard advice’. Examples of this include:

* Our policies around conferences and training
* Expenses:
  * The typical amount people can spend on a hotel
  * What is considered a valid business expense \(and what is not\)
  * Entertaining clients and teams

If you’re happy working within the framework that the standard advice has created then you don’t need to raise an AP. But if you want to challenge the standard advice, you should consider creating a new AP.

You should record in your decision why you disagree with the conventional way of doing things, so we can update the “standard advice” afterwards to help the next person.

## Tracking the Advice Process

At EE we track each AP in a simple Google sheet.

### Investment Tracking Overview for the Advice Process

* The Advice Process Tracker is the source of reference data needed to determine how to manage each advice process
* The Finance team will track actual money \(cash\) spent using current approval processes.
* Associates’ time that we will be paying for, will be captured using a non-billable timesheet in ETZ or Kimble \(depending on which system the associate is using\).
* All cash costs \(ie. excluding internal staff time\) of APs will be allocated to the Business Unit of the AP decision maker \(this may also be a Global pot, depending on the AP\).
* Employee time will be estimated in the AP, but not tracked.
* Opportunity costs won’t be estimated nor tracked.
* Where there are costs \(including time from associates that are billed to EE\), this data will be provided by the Finance team on a monthly basis.
* Invoices that arise from an AP \(e.g. for an associates non-billable time\) will be used by the Finance Team to report monthly on AP costs. They will be tied to the AP via an AP ID assigned to it when it’s added the [global tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eeu7q0cStaYkM7iU6JlmCqpwvNpglE7E2C7mbxvtfgc/edit?usp=sharing).
* Cost tracking will follow the current model used by finance, where the AP ID is added to any associated invoice for reporting. Every month, Finance will provide a spreadsheet of all AP costs that month.

### Changing the Status of an AP

To Abandon an AP, just post into the channel, your intention to abandon and why. This will be reflected in the tacker.

To Complete an AP you must have

* spent the money \(or enough to have done enough
* Captured lessons learnt and updated the AP result
* Presented at a Show and Tell

### Tracking each AP

Progress has been made on tracking AP with [Advice Process Proposals tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eeu7q0cStaYkM7iU6JlmCqpwvNpglE7E2C7mbxvtfgc) - which is awesome - this enables us to improve our tracking as tweaked below.

#### Categorise the AP

In the Tracker, the CFO will assign a category to the AP, using his judgement but based on the criteria below:

**Decisions**

This describes any AP that is required to meet the immediate needs of the business and is not speculative in nature. For instance “hire 1 recruiter to meet the demands of sold work” or “Get a bigger office because we run out of space”. Those decisions are still important to surface and discuss in the open. But once they have been made, they do not need to be tracked separately as an investment and will be included in the P&L of the business unit.

**Investments**

This is for anything that is seeking an improvement to our business that is speculative. We want to track those investment as a total global investment \(GIT\). This is so we can limit how much money we invest in these speculative initiatives. This is tracked under the “Finance Tracker” tab.

**We distinguish between:**

* Indirect Investment. Any improvement that does not contribute directly to the bottom line, or generate leads or sales. For instance, investing in Airtable or in co-working days to share knowledge.
* Direct Investment. Any thing we do with the explicit goal to contribute directly to the bottom line or generating leads or sales. For instance, having a Pre-Engagment Team or the Healthcare practice, or even hiring a new Sales person.

#### Limiting the total investment pot

Based on the categorisation above, we will constrain the global investment pot to £500K maximum spend between 1st October and 31st March - the end of this fiscal year.

AP Housekeeping

While we do our best to keep our processes as light as possible, we do need some. The following section describes the core documentation that we use to run our Advice Process at Equal Experts.

### Documents and templates

### 

#### Google Documents

**Advice Process Template:** The basic outline the provides the types of data we look to capture when creating an AP \(we ran through this in section 4 - Run your own AP\).

**Advice Process Drive:** A Google Drive folder, containing all historic and current APs.

**Advice Process Tracker:** Lists all APs created, alongside relevant data \(e.g. Decision Maker, value, tracked monthly spend\)

#### Slack channels

We use Slack intensively in Equal Experts – so it’s the natural choice for us to communicate information about the Advice Process, too.

We have the following channels set up to help move everything along:

* **\#ap\_learning\_group** – the global governance group of the Advice Process. Each country has its own learning group to aid with the roll-out and ongoing improvement of the process. You’ll find more info on this later in this section.
* **\#ap-decisions** – a global channel, where all Advice Processes and associated updates are published \(including meeting minutes from governance groups\).
* **\#ap-bul** – a place for Business Unit Leads to discuss and share appointments of AP decision makers and other related items.
* **\#ap-operations** – a place to discuss the day-to-day operations of the advice process.
* **\#ap-XXX** – when people create an advice process they will often create a temporary channel to discuss it with interested parties. This is not mandatory, but if you do, this is the naming format to use.

#### Monthly Show & Tell

Every month we run a show and tell, where people who have recently published APs in the \#ap-decisions channel take a 5-minute slot to present and discuss their specific AP. The purpose of the show and tell is to aid accountability and transparency – and most importantly, to share any learning along the way.

#### Standard AP checklist

These are the required processes for a standard AP:

1. Fill in the AP template
2. Post it in the \#ap-decisions Slack channel \(this may be after the decision is made\)
3. Update progress, material change or closure of the AP in the template.
4. Attend the Show & Tell when AP is published.

## Advice Process Learning Group

Using the Advice Process requires changes in behaviour and culture, and thus needs a little help to keep things moving along! We’ve found it useful to have a small group \(2-4 people\) focused on advocating and advancing usage of the AP. We call this the AP Learning Group. Each Business Unit that runs the AP is encouraged to have its own Learning Group, as well as a global group with representatives from across the regions.

### 

#### Who’s in the group?

Groups are managed locally – so contact your BUL to find out who is on your local group. The global group group is currently composed of: [Dave Hewett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-hewett-b97609/), [Thomas Granier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasgranier/), [Lyndsay Prewer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lyndsp/) and [Chris Cobb](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-cobb-88981a1/).

We intend to add/rotate more people into the Learning Group in future. If you have any questions and/or wish to take part, please contact your BUL or one of the names above. The main criterion for joining the AP Learning Group is a passion to drive the Advice Process forward.

#### Why’s the Learning Group needed?

We want to actively learn from the process, and learn from our mistakes. This is the first and main role of this group – to collect practical knowledge about the Advice Process so we can get better at it. Based on what we learn, we will seek to improve how we use the Advice Process at EE \(we understand that the Advice Process is initially confusing for many, and feels unnatural to most – especially those used to top-down decision making!\).

We meet at regular intervals to debate what’s working and what isn't, based on all the decisions going through the Advice Process.

Rest assured, we’re not looking to catch out people who are “doing it wrong”; we just aim to identify emerging good practices that we can share with everyone.

We’ll also use our learning to rollout better training for the Advice Process in due course. We really want to provide more comprehensive training around the Advice Process, but we need to better understand the user journey before we can do it properly.

So far, we’ve made good progress on how to explain the journey up to making a decision. We now need to learn more around what’s happening after the initial decision. In time, governance, feedback and learning from our decisions will improve the collective knowledge of the organisation.

#### Coaching people through the Advice Process

We appreciate that completing the advice process can feel like a daunting experience. The second role of the Learning Group is to act as a sounding board – we want to help everyone understand how, when and why they should use it \(this playbook is just one aspect of that\).

The people in the AP Learning Group will happily volunteer their time to coach anyone through the advice process, if they feel they would benefit from some support.

Coaching does not extend to executing on the decision, but it means you’ll have someone to ask questions while you go through the process. Asking for coaching is entirely optional, and up to the individual submitting the process.

Some example reasons why you might want to ask for some coaching:

* If you aren't sure who to ask for advice on the decision;
* If you aren't sure whether something should be an advice process or not;
* You want help on how best to use the Google Doc proposal template;
* You want help thinking about how to measure the results of the decision.

It’s important to understand we are all learning about this together - we do not have all the answers - sometimes our coaching could be leading you down the wrong path, feel free to disregard it!

#### What the Learning Group is not

* A crutch – we don’t want to hand-hold people, just help them get on with it
* A secret trove of knowledge – we don’t want to hoard information. If you have a question, put it on the [\#ap-decisions](https://equalexperts.slack.com/messages/CCFLF2KM5) Slack channel so we can answer it for everyone to see. If you’d rather speak privately first, please take the time to write up what you learn on Slack afterwards. We will try to disseminate info as much as possible, but if you help it’s going to be more effective.
* A conflict resolution board. Even if we are happy to discuss issues, the purpose of this group is not to resolve conflict.
* A judging panel. We’re not looking to catch out people who are “doing it wrong”, we’re seeking emerging good practices to improve the process.

#### Learning for the long term

We want to stress that the Advice Process is not a fad; we’re not doing this just because Thomas read ["Reinventing Organisations"](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/) a year ago. While it’s no panacea and might even be replaced by something else eventually, at this point we believe the Advice Process is an important way to help _all_ of us learn how to make decisions in an alternative way to the traditional top down model. We need to learn this not just as individuals but also as an entire organisation.

This learning is a key step as we evolve towards self-management, which is a key part of our [long term strategy](https://docs.google.com/a/equalexperts.com/presentation/d/15eoNS1VHNGzoNFBL8Ikt0cwR7dUpn6m-xumdX_jQ27w/edit?usp=sharing).
