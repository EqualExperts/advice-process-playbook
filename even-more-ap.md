        </p>
        <p>Written in the same style as &#x2018;The Phoenix Project&#x2019; (or &#x2018;The
          Goal&#x2019; for the more discerning reader) this is a serious business
          book written as fiction to help explain the benefits for the Advice Process.
          If you like this style of writing then it&apos;s a great way to get to
          grips with the benefits and pitfalls of the advice process.</p>

        <p>Also written by Dennis Bakke, this is a summary of the author&#x2019;s
          time at AEG and how he introduced the &#x2018;Decision Maker&#x2019; systems
          in his company. This is the genesis for the Advice Process framework, and
          a must-read if you want to implement something like it into your own organisation.</p>

        <p>A summary book that captures experiences from a number of organisations
          that follow the self management guides. It was based on surveys of organisations,
          but focuses on a small number of companies that have been successful in
          this style of management.</p>

        </p>
        <p>This is the first book to offer specific suggestions on how to replace
          performance appraisals with a more effective system that emphasizes teamwork
          and empowerment. Feedback, compensation, coaching, promotion, and legal
          documentation are all covered, as well as a variety of new alternatives
          that produce better results for both managers and employees.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Well worth a read. Covers open organisations and organisation design at
          scale, whilst changing structure from very closed to very open systems.
          Given that the context is the US intelligence services, the cultural challenges
          and resulting changes reported here are quite remarkable.</p>

          a few of the things we do to make Equal Experts that bit different</p>
