# Tracking the Advice Process

## Investment Tracking Overview

We track all APs in the [Advice Process Proposals tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eeu7q0cStaYkM7iU6JlmCqpwvNpglE7E2C7mbxvtfgc) which helps us to improve our reporting and monitoring. It is the reference source to determine how to manage each advice process**.**

### Categorising an AP

In the Tracker, our COO assigns a category to the AP, using his judgement based on the criteria below:

**Decisions**

An AP that is required to meet the immediate needs of a business unit, are costed within the BU's P&L and has no global investment needs. We still want to surface and record these decisions, but don't collectively track them as investments. E.g. “hire 1 recruiter to meet the demands of sold work” or “Get a bigger office because we run out of space”. Those decisions are still important to surface and discuss in the open.

**Investments**

Any AP that is seeking to improve our business that is speculative is considered an investment. We track these as a total global investment \(GIT\) so we can monitor - and ultimately limit - how much money we invest in these. We distinguish between:

* _Indirect Investment_. Any improvement that does not contribute directly to the bottom line, or generate sales \(or leads\). E.g. investing in Airtable solutions, or in co-working days to share knowledge.
* _Direct Investment_. Any thing we do that is explicitly to contribute to the bottom line through generating leads or sales. E.g. creating a pre-engagment team or a  Healthcare practice.
* _Practice Investment_.  category is used where the AP is directly related to the investment in a practice only.

### **Allocating costs for an AP**

We allocate costs for an AP to one of three places; Business Units, Practices or Global Investments. We apply these principles:

1. If an AP is clearly part of the ‘business as usual’ for either a BU or Practice, then it will be allocated directly to them.
2. If an AP is not BAU but has a clear focus on the local needs of a BU or Practice then it will be allocated to them. 
3. If the AP is not clearly above or is explicitly for more than one BU \(even within a country\) it will be allocated to Global Investments.

Other things to remember:

* You mush use the APID for your AP on invoices for payment, and on any timesheets setup \(this can be found on your AP, or in the Advice Process Tracker\)
* The APID is essential for all invoices, expenses and timesheets.
* Invoices from Associates cannot be paid without a non-billable timesheet, don't forget to get one setup in plenty of time.
* We don't estimate or track opportunity costs for employees.

**Tracking Cash**

This means any actual money that we have to spend, such as paying an associate or paying for a venue. The Finance \(Account Payable\) team will track actual money \(cash\) spent using current approval processes, using the APIDs. 

* the APID is used on any invoices that need paying at the time you approve them. This can just be a note when you send the invoice by email \(accounts@equalexperts.com\).
* highlight the APID in the Project field of any [expense claim](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EXFneU4mISmwDSdz3w1x-4WLvMPUAfRQYYm6L8YPPlU/edit#heading=h.iy5lcle9hh4f) submitted.

**Tracking time**

We track the time spent by employees and associates on APs, where

* the AP is allocated to the Global Investment, and
* a significant amount of an employee's time is dedicated to the AP. Use your judgement on what is significant, but as a rule of thumb would be more than half of a working month.
* all of an Associate's time on an AP must have a non-billable timesheets created. Please ask on [\#ask-timesheets](https://equalexperts.slack.com/messages/CEFMH0XQ9) with the BU and APID as needed. Associates’ invoices can't be paid without a non-billable timesheet \(either in Kimble or ETZ, , depending on which tool the Associate is setup to use.\)

Please agree with the person\(s\) involved and then request a timesheet on \#ask-timesheets as above.  We never track small amounts of time spent by an employee, like a day a week, or ad-hoc time.

### Changing the Status of an AP

To Complete your AP, you need to make sure you [complete all the steps.](../how-the-ap-works/learn-and-complete-the-ap.md)

To Abandon an AP, just post into the channel, your intention to abandon and why. This will be reflected in the tracker by the AP Operations team.

### Limiting the global investment pot

Based on the categorisation above, we will constrain the global investment pot maximum spend between 1st October and 31st March \(amount TBC\) - the end of this fiscal year.
