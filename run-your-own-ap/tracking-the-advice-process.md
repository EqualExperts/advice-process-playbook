# Tracking the Advice Process

## Investment Tracking Overview for the Advice Process

* The Advice Process Tracker is the source of reference data needed to determine how to manage each advice process
* The Finance team will track actual money \(cash\) spent using current approval processes.
* Associates’ time that we will be paying for, will be captured using a non-billable timesheet in ETZ or Kimble \(depending on which system the associate is using\).
* All cash costs \(ie. excluding internal staff time\) of APs will be allocated to the Business Unit of the AP decision maker \(this may also be a Global pot, depending on the AP\).
* Employee time will be estimated in the AP, but not tracked.
* Opportunity costs won’t be estimated nor tracked.
* Where there are costs \(including time from associates that are billed to EE\), this data will be provided by the Finance team on a monthly basis.
* Invoices that arise from an AP \(e.g. for an associates non-billable time\) will be used by the Finance Team to report monthly on AP costs. They will be tied to the AP via an AP ID assigned to it when it’s added the [global tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eeu7q0cStaYkM7iU6JlmCqpwvNpglE7E2C7mbxvtfgc/edit?usp=sharing).
* Cost tracking will follow the current model used by finance, where the AP ID is added to any associated invoice for reporting. Every month, Finance will provide a spreadsheet of all AP costs that month.

### Changing the Status of an AP

To Abandon an AP, just post into the channel, your intention to abandon and why. This will be reflected in the tacker.

To Complete an AP you must have

* spent the money \(or enough to have done enough
* Captured lessons learnt and updated the AP result
* Presented at a Show and Tell

### Tracking each AP

Progress has been made on tracking AP with [Advice Process Proposals tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eeu7q0cStaYkM7iU6JlmCqpwvNpglE7E2C7mbxvtfgc) - which is awesome - this enables us to improve our tracking as tweaked below.

#### Categorise the AP

In the Tracker, the CFO will assign a category to the AP, using his judgement but based on the criteria below:

**Decisions**

This describes any AP that is required to meet the immediate needs of the business and is not speculative in nature. For instance “hire 1 recruiter to meet the demands of sold work” or “Get a bigger office because we run out of space”. Those decisions are still important to surface and discuss in the open. But once they have been made, they do not need to be tracked separately as an investment and will be included in the P&L of the business unit.

**Investments**

This is for anything that is seeking an improvement to our business that is speculative. We want to track those investment as a total global investment \(GIT\). This is so we can limit how much money we invest in these speculative initiatives. This is tracked under the “Finance Tracker” tab.

**We distinguish between:**

* Indirect Investment. Any improvement that does not contribute directly to the bottom line, or generate leads or sales. For instance, investing in Airtable or in co-working days to share knowledge.
* Direct Investment. Any thing we do with the explicit goal to contribute directly to the bottom line or generating leads or sales. For instance, having a Pre-Engagment Team or the Healthcare practice, or even hiring a new Sales person.

#### Limiting the total investment pot

Based on the categorisation above, we will constrain the global investment pot maximum spend between 1st October and 31st March \(amount TBC\) - the end of this fiscal year.
