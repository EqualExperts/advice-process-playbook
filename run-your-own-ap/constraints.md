description: What constraints do APs need to operate within

# Constraints

## Our intent

The Advice process is used for many kind of decisions at EE - from BAU decisions to process improvements to speculative investments. We want to keep APs as focussed as possible while providing enough information about the global and local context of EE for people to make informed decisions.

## Our approach

We started the AP process with cost thresholds that determine whether the decision maker needs to be confirmed or not. We decided to add a set of constraints that we think will help keep the APs focussed \(WIP limit, short duration\), as well as give some global context \(Global investment pot\).

## Constraints

### WIP Limit: 2 on-going APs

One person can only be the decision maker for 2 on-going AP at any given time. If you want to open another AP and already have 2 APs in flight, you will have to abandon or complete existing ones, before opening another.

### Duration: 3 months max

We want APs to be as short as possible - both to encourage small steps, accelerated learning and a short payback period 1-3 months.  Three months currently the maximum duration of an AP.

### Global investment pot

Some APs cover speculative investments - whether they are intended to contribute directly to the bottom line or help improve other aspects of the network. [Those investments are tracked](tracking-the-advice-process.md#categorise-the-ap) as part of a global investment pot. This helps everyone to understand what is the impact of their APs on the profitability of EE globally.

If the global investment pot gets fully allocated to existing APs, no other APs of the same nature can be created - unless some existing APs get abandoned.

For 1st October 2019 to 31st March 2020, the global investment pot is fixed at £XXX \(which represent X% of our forecasted profits over the same period\).

### Cost of the AP 

* **For decisions under a certain cost threshold \(**[**outlined in the table below**](constraints.md#value-threshold-by-business-unit)**\), any employee who is part of a Business Unit \(BU\) that’s adopted the AP** [**can appoint themselves as decision maker**](../how-the-ap-works/confirming-the-decision-maker.md#confirming-the-decision-maker)**.** 
* Above this cost threshold and below £20,000, if an AP impacts a single BU, then the relevant Business Unit Lead \(BUL\) needs to [confirm the decision maker](../how-the-ap-works/confirming-the-decision-maker.md#high-value-large-impact-decisions).
* For any decision that spans across Business Units, or not covered by the two points above, the Exec Team [confirms the decision maker](../how-the-ap-works/confirming-the-decision-maker.md#high-value-large-impact-decisions).

### Cost threshold by Business Unit

Under the listed threshold, any employee can appoint themselves the decision maker \(unless the decision is deemed to have a bigger impact, or affect more than a single BU\).
