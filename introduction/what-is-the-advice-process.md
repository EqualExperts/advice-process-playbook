# What is the Advice Process?

Companies of a certain size need some kind of corporate governance; the Advice Process is ours. It’s an unusual way to approach governance – because it empowers any EE employee to make meaningful decisions, rather than wait to be told what to do \(as with a traditional top-down or consensus-driven arrangement\).

Instead of having to refer ‘up’ all the time when faced with decisions, as its name suggests the Advice Process simply requires people to ask for advice from appropriate colleagues. This should be a tremendously empowering thing for all of us \(especially when we consider that the common alternative is the traditional top-down model, with investment committees, long proposals and 100 hoops to jump through whenever you want to try and use your initiative\).

The Advice Process means that power isn’t held in the hands of an elite few at Equal Experts; decision-making is spread across the organisation. But distributing power across organisations is hard, so it’s up to everyone in EE to make this work. We don’t want to end up as just another consultancy!
