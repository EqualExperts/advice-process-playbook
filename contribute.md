Guides like this are never complete. There will always be improvements we can make and as more teams use these practices in a wider variety of contexts - some of which we may not have envisioned. To help ensure this playbook remains relevant and useful, we welcome contributions from anyone in the wider software engineering community. Please see the contribution guidelines if you're interested in helping out.
