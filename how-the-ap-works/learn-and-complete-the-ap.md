# Learn and complete the AP

It is really important that you complete an AP having learned something and shared that knowledge.

To complete an AP you must have :

* Implemented your decision \(or have learn enough to decide itâ€™s time to stop\)
* Ensured the actual spend has been recorded by the Finance team
* Captured lessons learnt and [updated the AP result](../run-your-own-ap/where-to-start.md#the-ap-template) section
* Published an internal blog post summarising the AP what and why, the result and learnings. It's important to include details of:
  1. Actual vs estimated cost.
  2. Actual outcomes in relation to success metrics.
  3. Any next steps that follow the AP.
